This Ipython file can be viewed directly from Github by simply clicking the FINAL_ATUS.ipynb file in the repository, which contains the final work and summaries of findings. If you would like to manipulate the Ipython notebook yourself you can install the requirements by running pip install -r 'requirements.txt' from the terminal.

This data comes from the American Time Use Survey. It is a large set of data polling over 159,000 Americans between 2003 and 2014. Each respondent was asked to keep a thorough 'diary day' and then relayed the information to the interviewer. These samples are therefore simply random days from random Americans lives.
